# Alpha Hunt Reference

## What is Alpha Hunt?

Alpha Hunt is Meta Claw's core intelligence capability.
It combines on-chain data, social signals, and agent analysis to surface
actionable opportunities before they're widely known.

## Hunt Types

### Token Volume Hunt
Find tokens with unusual volume spikes.
```
"meta claw hunt: tokens on Base with >5x volume in 6h"
"find new tokens on Solana with rising buy pressure today"
```

### Whale Wallet Tracking
Monitor significant wallet activity.
```
"track whale accumulation on Base this week"
"show wallets that bought [token] before last 3 pumps"
"find new whale positions opened in last 24h"
```

### Narrative Detection
Identify emerging on-chain and social narratives.
```
"what narratives are trending on Base right now?"
"detect new meta on Solana this week"
"find tokens benefiting from AI narrative today"
```

### Liquidity Flow Analysis
Track capital movement across chains.
```
"where is liquidity flowing from Ethereum today?"
"show cross-chain bridges inflow to Base this week"
"track USDC movement between chains last 48h"
```

## Output Format

Every alpha hunt returns:
- Token/wallet/narrative identified
- Signal strength (1–10)
- On-chain evidence (tx hashes)
- Suggested action (entry, monitor, avoid)
- Confidence score

## Running a Standalone Hunt (No Mission)
